        <Accordion.Header>What is the typical duration of a digital marketing campaign?  </Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
        You cannot truly forecast or tell a digital marketing campaign's "typical" duration. Digital marketing campaigns are like real-life movements, an ongoing process that ends with a conclusion. A campaign duration can be short or long, depending on the goals and budget.<br></br>
        <div style={{paddingTop:'10px'}}>    The campaign duration is more prolonged if you want to build a brand from scratch, create awareness, and increase consumer loyalty. However, the campaign duration will likely be shorter if you are only looking to generate leads and increase traffic.</div>
