        <Accordion.Header>What is 3D animation, and how does it differ from 2D animation?</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
        At first, images were used to get our attention, then came videos, 3D, VR, and who knows what is next. <br></br>
        <div style={{paddingTop:'10px'}}>      3D animation is the process of creating movable content in three dimensions. The animators use high-end software to create 3D models, characters, and everything else. These animations give you a realistic and immersive way to show any perspective.</div> <br></br>
        <div style={{paddingTop:'10px'}}>       However, 2D animation is like crafting a brochure or flyer. The creation moves in two-dimensional space like a painting hanging on your home wall. You do not get the opportunity to take your audience's attention on a deeper level using 2D animation services. They are far from realistic but can be crafted manually using human hands.</div>
